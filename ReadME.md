# Poker Hand Strength Evaluator

## Where do you come from?

I come from 'Scala Times' weekly newspaper ;)
### How much time did you spend on me?
I've never played Poker, and I was not familiar with it;) It took me 2 days of effort. I work at company, so I did 
not 
have enough time to write a 
sexy code.
But it works!

### What are the pros and cons?
* It seems it is a  maintainable code, so you can add many Poker style games and features.
* In my opinion calculating a lots of permutation maybe is not a good solution. This part should be improved.
* Some corner cases and validations maybe have not been covered because of lack of time.
* FP concepts have not been applied to this code. It's because I'm far from my golden age of scala development. But 
  I've tried to write more declarative code with the power of Java stream APIs.
